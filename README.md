# Guess-Number-Game
This projects shows my skill with HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript. The styling has been done by the CSS without any framework while the game logic has been implemented with the help of JavaScript. This project helped me learn about DOM manipulation where I learned about .addEventListener, CSS manipulation , changing textContent and value readings.
